# sql-challenge
This database code involves the design and creation of a relational database for managing employee information within an organization. The database schema includes tables for employee titles, employee details, departments, department managers, department employees, and employee salaries. The assignment aims to demonstrate proficiency in SQL by performing various queries on this database.

I did import each data into each table using the import/export into each individual table that was craeted I am not sure how this will show up in the code in Github because you can't neccessarily see that I did it.

This code not only demonstrates the creation of a well-structured database but also showcases the ability to write SQL queries to extract meaningful information. The relational database model employed in this assignment enables efficient data organization and retrieval, laying a foundation for effective data management within an organizational context.
